Android Agenda Widget is a home screen widget for Android devices.

It can display data from various applications including:

  * Google Calendar
  * Google Calendar API 2.2 (Froyo)
  * HTC/Google Calendar
  * Droid Corporate Calendar
  * Astrid
  * SSI gTasks

This Google code page is used for issue tracking and as a repository for open source components of the application.

The main application itself is **not** open source.

The source in this project will grow as I separate functionality (such as the calendar provider) from the main project which is hosted elsewhere. For now the application itself isn't open source, but it will be eventually when I decide to stop developing new functionality for it :)
